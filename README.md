# Project 1: Build Your Personal Website with AI!

This repository contains a clean, modern, single-page personal portfolio built with plain HTML and CSS (no frameworks). The site is mobile-responsive, uses Google Fonts and Font Awesome for icons, and is ready to deploy to GitHub Pages.

What you'll find in this repo:

- `index.html` — the complete single-page portfolio (Hero, About, Skills, Projects, Contact, Footer).
- `style.css` — styles, responsive rules, and layout using Flexbox / CSS Grid.
- `img/` — (optional) image assets you can add for projects or avatars.

Quick local preview

1. Open the repository in your editor (or Codespaces).
2. Open `index.html` in the browser (right-click → Open with Live Server, or open the file directly).

Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. Commit and push the current branch (usually `main`):

```bash
git add index.html style.css README.md
git commit -m "Add portfolio site"
git push origin main
```

2. On GitHub, go to this repository → Settings → Pages.
3. Under "Source" select the `main` branch and the `/ (root)` folder, then click "Save".
4. After a minute, your site will be available at: `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

Notes and next steps

- Replace placeholder project links and the contact email in `index.html` with your real URLs and address.
- Add images to the `img/` folder and reference them from the Projects section if desired.
- If you want a custom domain, add it in the Pages settings and follow the DNS instructions.

If you want, I can update the README with a live demo URL after you publish, and replace placeholder content with your personal details.
